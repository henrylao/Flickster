### Notes
* Still experiencing difficulties when configuring the stars to be properly displayed need to do a little bit more research into the rating bar widget
* Still experiencing issues with images not being displayed despite async client properly fetching image urls requiring inclusion of <android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"> in the android MANIFEST.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
